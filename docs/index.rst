============================
OnToma is a Python module which maps the disease or phenotype terms to the ontology used in the Open Targets platform.

The ontology used in the Open Targets platform is a subset (aka. *slim*) of the EFO ontology *plus* any HPO terms for which a valid EFO mapping could not be found.

This package tries to take the final structure into account and avoids mapping to terms that are not currently in the ontology.
